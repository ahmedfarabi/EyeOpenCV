# EyeOpenCV
The purpose of this project is Controlling a robotic eye by detecting human eye movement through Image Processing.
For image processing OpenCV is used. The code can detect human eye movement using a camera module connected with the computer and
send commands through serial ports.
The Arduino code is for getting the commands and act according to that command.
